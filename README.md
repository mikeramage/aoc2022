Here we go again.

## Day 1
Spent a while coercing things into the right types to stop the compiler moaning, but I think this is actually OK. Amazing.

## Day 2
Fine. I'm getting along with the Rust compiler a bit better this time round. Some slight String vs char vs str pain about parsing the input into a vector, but apart from that surprisingly OK. Let's see how I do when the going gets tough on later days ... 

## Day 3 
The rot begins. I've produced some utterly manky code that gets the result out, but it makes me very sad. I'll refactor if I have time. But I don't have time - I have kids.
