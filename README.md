Here we go again.

## Day 1
Spent a while coercing things into the right types to stop the compiler moaning, but I think this is actually OK. Amazing.

## Day 2
Fine. I'm getting along with the Rust compiler a bit better this time round. Some slight String vs char vs str pain about parsing the input into a vector, but apart from that surprisingly OK. Let's see how I do when the going gets tough on later days ... 

## Day 3 
The rot begins. I've produced some utterly manky code that gets the result out, but it makes me very sad. I'll refactor if I have time. But I don't have time - I have kids. 

## Day 4
Easy enough. Can't remember a whole lot about this one.

## Day 5
Popping crates 'n' stuff. Lots of code, can't remember what it does.

## Day 6
Boiled it down to effectively 3 lines of code. Boom. This is probably the only effort I'm happy with. It was an easy day though...

## Day 7
... and I follow it up with this hideous garbage. Grotesque code, written by a moron.

## Day 8
And I thought day 7 was a poor showing. This is like someone fumbling around learning to code in C.

## Day 9
Not bad I suppose. Quite methodical. I'm sure there's a way to do this in 3 lines, though. Took me about 100.

## Day 10
RKAZAJBR - that's what I shouted at the compiler. 

## Day 11
Monkey business. Enjoyed this one, and I'm pretty happy with my code for a change.
